BOOLEAN LOGIC QUESTIONS

Part I
Write down what the following statements will return. Try to figure this out before putting the commands in the chrome console.
1.	2 == "2";true
2.	2 === 2;true
3.	10 % 3;1
4.	10 % 3 === 1;true
5.	true && false;false
6.	false || true;false
7.	true || false;false

Part II
Answer the following questions about this code block:

let isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}

1.	What should the above code console.log?
2.	Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?

let firstvariable;
let secondvariable = "";
let thirdvariable = 1;
let secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstvariable){
    console.log("first");
} else if(firstvariable || secondvariable){
    console.log("second");
} else if(firstvariable || thirdvariable){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}

1.	What should the above code console.log? Why?
2.	What is the value of firstvariable when it is initialized?
3.	Is the value of firstvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
4.	Is the value of secondvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
5.	Is the value of thirdvariable a "truthy" value? Why?

Part III
1.	Research Math.random and write an if statement that console.log's "Over 0.5" if Math.random returns a number greater than 0.5. Otherwise console.log "Under 0.5".

2.	What is a falsey value? List all the falsey values in JavaScript.
