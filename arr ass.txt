Part I 
Write the code necessary to do the following
1. Create an empty array called arr. 
answer
let arr = [];

2. Add your first name to the arr variable 
answer
let arr = [];
let removeitem = arr.push('mohammed');
console.log(arr);

3. Add your last name to the end of the arr variable 
amswer
let arr = ['mohammed'];
let removeitem = arr.push('ayomide');
console.log(arr);

4. Add your favorite color to the beginning of the arr variable Your variable arr should look like this 
(using Elie for a first name, Schoppik for a last name and purple for a favorite color) ["purple", "Elie", "Schoppik"]. Keep going! 
answer
let arr = ['Elie','Schoppik'];
let newlength = arr.unshift('Purple');
console.log(arr);

5. Remove the favorite color from the in the array-arrvariable (remember this is the first value what method 
can you use to remove the first value in an array?) 
answer
let arr = ['Purple','Elie','Schoppik'];
let removeItem = arr.shift();
console.log(arr);

6. Create another array called arr2
answer
let arr2 = [];

7. Add your favorite number to arr2 	
answer
let arr2 = [];  
let removeitem = arr2.push(42);
console.log(arr2);

8. 	Add the string "JavaScript" to the end of the arr2 variable Your variable arr2 should look like this (using 42 as a favorite number) [42, 
"JavaScript"]. 
answer
let arr2 = [42];
let removeditem = arr2.push('JavaScipt');
console.log(arr2);

9. • 	See if the value 	42
 exists in the 	arr2
 array. Do this using the return to you if the value passed to it can not be found in the 	indexOf
 method. 
	What does array? 	indexOf
answer
let arr2 = [42, 'JavaScript'];
arr2.indexof[42];
console.log(arr2);







10. • 	combinedArr
Create a new variable called 	 which is the result of 
	your 	arr	 and 	arr2	 variables combined into one array. 
Your combinedArr variable should look like this (using our previous values) ["Elie","Schoppik", 42, "JavaScript"] 
answer
let arr = ['Elie","Schoppik'];
let arr2 = [ 42, 'JavaScript'];
let combiend = arr.concat(arr2);
combiend;


Part II 
Complete the following, starting from the following array: let arr = ["JavaScript", 
"Python", "Ruby", "Java"] 

1. 1. Return the following array: ["Python", "Ruby"]. 
answer
let arr = ["Python", "Ruby"];



2. Combine the array with the array ["Haskell", "Clojure"]
answer
let arr = ['Python','Ruby'];
let arr2 = ['Haskell','Clojure'];
let combiend = arr.concat(arr2);
combiend;


3.Return the string "JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java"
answer
let arr = ['Python', 'Ruby', 'Haskell', 'Clojure'];
arr.splice(2, 2, 'java');
arr.unshift('javascript');
console.log(arr);


4. Try to explain, in your own words (or diagrams!) what the difference is between passing by value vs. passing by reference
answer
passing value: means passing a variable into function 
passing reference:means passing an argument in the calling function
