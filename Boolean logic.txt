BOOLEAN LOGIC QUESTIONS

Part I
Write down what the following statements will return. Try to figure this out before putting the commands in the chrome console.
1.	2 == "2";
2.	2 === 2;
3.	10 % 3;
4.	10 % 3 === 1;
5.	true && false;
6.	false || true;
7.	true || false;
Answer:
	2 == "2";//true
	2 === 2;//true
	10 % 3;//1
	10 % 3 === 1;//true
	true && false;//false
	false || true;//true
	true || false;//true

Part II
Answer the following questions about this code block:

let isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}

1.	What should the above code console.log?
2.	Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?
Answer 1:
"Keep it up!"
Answer 2:
They mean the same thing. isLearning was defined as true above the conditional statement.

let firstvariable;
let secondvariable = "";
let thirdvariable = 1;
let secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstvariable){
    console.log("first");
} else if(firstvariable || secondvariable){
    console.log("second");
} else if(firstvariable || thirdvariable){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}

1.	What should the above code console.log? Why?
2.	What is the value of firstvariable when it is initialized?
3.	Is the value of firstvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
4.	Is the value of secondvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
5.	Is the value of thirdvariable a "truthy" value? Why?

Answer 1: 
"third" because firstVariable and secondVariable are falsey values.
Answer 2: 
undefined
Answer 3: 
No, undefined is a falsey value.
Answer 4: 
No, an empty string is a falsey value.
Answer 5: 
Yes, the number 1 is truthy.

Part III
1.	Research Math.random and write an if statement that console.log's "Over 0.5" if Math.random returns a number greater than 0.5. Otherwise console.log "Under 0.5".

Answer 1:
if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
  console.log("Over 0.5") 
} else {
  console.log("Under 0.5")
}
2.	What is a falsey value? List all the falsey values in JavaScript.
Answer 2:
Falsey values evaluate to false in a conditional statement. undefined, null,false,nan,""
